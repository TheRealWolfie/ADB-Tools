## Android Development Tools
This repo contains several useful tools and scripts to be used with various Android development activities.

As an enthusiast and tinkerer with no formal background in porting roms to unofficial or unsupported devices, I decided to create this repo to share with anyone who might find it useful..

With a lot of trial and error, I'm going to be adding more stuff to this repo as I continue with this learning adventure!
